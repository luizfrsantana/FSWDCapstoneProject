# Network Device Management Front-End This is a React-based front-end application for managing network devices and configurations. It interacts with a Flask back-end API to authenticate users, manage network devices, interfaces, and connections, and displays network data through a user-friendly interface. ## Features - **Authentication**: Login and JWT-based authorization to protect routes. - **User Management**: Add, update, and delete users, with role-based access. - **Device Management**: Display, add, update, and delete network devices, with details on their specifications and status. - **Interface Management**: View and update network interfaces for each device. - **Connection Management**: Manage and display connections between network devices. - **Interactive Network Map**: Visualize network connections with an interactive map. ## Requirements - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - [React Data Table Component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-data-table-component) - [JWT Decode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode) - [Vis Network](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vis-network) ## Setup and Installation 1. **Clone the Repository** ```bash git clone https://github.com/your_username/network-device-management-frontend.git cd network-device-management-frontend ``` 2. **Install Dependencies** ```bash npm install ``` 3. **Run the Application** ```bash npm start ``` The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. ## Project Structure - **`App.js`**: Main component with routes for different pages. - **`components/`**: Contains all the individual components: - **Banner**: Displays a banner image on top of each page. - **Navigation**: Main navigation menu with links to different pages. - **Home**: Homepage with an overview of the application features. - **UserPage, DevicePage, InterfacePage, ConnectionPage**: Pages for managing users, devices, interfaces, and connections, respectively. - **LoginPage**: Login page for user authentication. - **PrivateRoute**: Protects routes based on JWT authentication. - **NetworkMap**: Displays network connections visually using Vis Network. ## Usage ### Authentication - Users can log in with their credentials on the **Login Page**. - **JWT** tokens are stored in `localStorage` to manage user sessions. - Routes under `PrivateRoute` are accessible only to authenticated users. ### User Management - Accessible via `/users` route for Admin and full-access roles. - Allows adding, updating, and deleting users with roles like `administrator`, `full-access`, and `read-only`. ### Device Management - Accessible via `/devices` route. - View, add, update, or delete network devices. - Displays details like device name, IP, vendor, status, installation date, and more. ### Interface Management - Accessible via `/interfaces` route. - View interfaces of each device, update their descriptions and IP addresses. - Synchronize interface data with the back-end. ### Connection Management - Accessible via `/connections` route. - Manage connections between devices by specifying interfaces and connection types. - Displays connections with details such as speed, status, and description. ### Interactive Network Map - Visualizes the connections between devices using an interactive map. - Allows users to see the network topology and connection types. ## Additional Notes - **Environment Variables**: Ensure to set up the correct back-end API URL in the code for API requests. - **Error Handling**: Each component includes error handling for network requests. - **Styling**: Basic styling is applied using CSS files specific to each component. ## License This project is licensed under the MIT License. ## Contact For questions or contributions, please contact [Your Email].
